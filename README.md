# Data-Mining-Midterm-Project
In this repository, I published the code that I used as a midterm project for IZTECH's Computer Engineering Department's Data Mining course. Firstly, I did some rearrangements on the data and cleansing at the same time for getting a sensible dataset to work with. After that, among various machine learning algorithms, the most proper one has been chosen to work with by observing the performance of the model on validation data.

For being able to upload the test.csv file due to the size problem, I dropped around 194.000 data. Don't be afraid to get in touch with me for getting all of the data.
